I am a Web Designer and Graphic artist based in east Kent. I enjoy creating smart, entertaining and functional web sites and eye catching branding.

### More Information

After studying graphic design at A level and getting a good grade (A*) I wasn't too sure what to do with myself. Studying Economics at Kent sounded like a good idea until I realised what I really want to do is make pretty things on the internet. So pretty much everything I've done I had to teach myself (with some fantastic help from friends), with this I've had a lot of fun and I like to experiment on different projects to push my limits and learn more.

I also work part time at the Bottle Shop in Canterbury. You can find me there most Thursday evening talking about beer, life, technology and other nice things.
